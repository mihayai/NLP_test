# NLP_test
test for NLP course for Projector
I checked 
https://github.com/mbr/asciitree
the word 'trees' is in the parensis

for 
(asciitree (sometimes you) (just (want to draw)) (trees) (in (your terminal)))

result is

asciitree
+-- sometimes
|   +-- you
+-- just
|   +-- want
|       +-- to
|       +-- draw
+-- trees
+-- in
|   +-- your
|       +-- terminal

and when the word "trees" is not in the parensis. (The word "trees" and "asciitree" are on the same level) 
(asciitree (sometimes you) (just (want to draw)) trees (in (your terminal)))
